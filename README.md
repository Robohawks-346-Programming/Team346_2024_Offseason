# Offseason Robot Code
The purpose of this repo is to test new software with the existing 2024 comp robot, Khaos. The reason for creating a new repo and not branch is because the entire code will be revamped and it is cleaner to start fresh.

## Planned Changes
- [ ] Advantage Kit
- [ ] CTRE Swerve Generator
- [ ] Updated Commands trees
- [ ] Branching Autos
- [ ] Better Kalman Filters for vision
- [ ] Driver Automation regarding note detection, shooting, amping, and trapping
